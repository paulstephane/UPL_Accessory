Simple program to assist in copying music files to USB keys in a format compatible with the use of ECDesign's UPL96ETL.

The program works on Windows only, for the time being. It requires installing Kid3 and dBpoweramp's music converter:

The location (folder) of the programs need to be added to Window's path variable.
